Write a recursive function that counts how many even numbers are in an array of integers.
The function should return a number representing the count of even values found.

Examples:

```js
countEvens([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) → 3
countEvens([1, 3, 5]) → 0
countEvens([]) → 0
countEvens([2, 4, 6, 8]) → 4
```
