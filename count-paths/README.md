Imagine you are in the top-left corner of a grid with m rows and n columns.
You can only move right or down.

Write a recursive function that returns the number of unique paths from the top-left to the bottom-right corner.

Examples:

```
gridPaths(1, 1) → 1
gridPaths(2, 2) → 2
gridPaths(3, 2) → 3
gridPaths(3, 3) → 6
```
