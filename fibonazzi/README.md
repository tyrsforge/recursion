Write a recursive function that returns the n-th Fibonacci number.
The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:

```
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21...
```

Examples:

```
fib(0) → 0
fib(1) → 1
fib(2) → 1
fib(5) → 5
fib(7) → 13
```

**Extra**: after you have the basic version, try to implement an optimized one using memoization to avoid redundant recursive calls.
