# Recursion Practice and Katas

This repository contains a collection of programming exercises and katas focused on recursion. Each challenge explores different recursive problem-solving patterns â€” from simple function calls to advanced divide-and-conquer algorithms.

The main goal is to strengthen recursive thinking and develop a deeper understanding of how to decompose complex problems into smaller, elegant solutions through recursion.
